# MySQL

Sample NodeJS + Express + REST API + MySQL integration

## Definitions

**Node.js** is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the Chrome V8 engine and allows JavaScript code to run outside of a web browser.

**Express** is a routing and middleware web framework for NodeJS that manages data flow between the server and routes in server-side applications.

**REST** stands for Representational State Transfer. A **RESTful API** is an architectural style for an App.

**MySQL** is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to query the database.

**Database connection pooling** utilizes caching to keep database connections open so that the connections can be reused while an application is running.

In the terminal, run:
